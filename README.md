## Welcome to DEADWEIGHT

You are working your 9-5 construction job but your robot assistant's battery **died!** Your corporate bosses are insistent on keeping all the batteries at the top of the site, so now you're **stuck climbing the tower** to charge your robot back up....

> [!IMPORTANT]
>> This game was developed in ~30 hours for the 2024 [Kenney Jam](https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2024). The theme for this jam was Connection and we were required to only use assets made by **[Kenney](https://kenney.nl/)** (excluding *fonts & sounds*). We plan on polishing the mechanics and visuals and expanding in the future.
